# Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution - Pro-Bono Project

## Summary
This is a pro-bono project with the goal of creating data visualizations & zip code prioritizations to aid public health officials as they decide where & how to distribute the covid-19 vaccines & what equity metrics to use to track distribution. We're currently focused on CA, since that's where we live, but can run a similar analysis on any of the 50 US states. Reach out if you think your state or county would be interested. 

## Problem 
State Public Health Officials are tackling unprescidented logistical, financial and trust challenges in distributing the covid-19 vaccine in addition to racial and ethnic disparities. 

## Data
We use several data sources to visualize covid's cumulative impact on various counties in California including: census data, Healthy Places Index, and CCVI scores.
